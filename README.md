# Employee-SQL
# Exploring Mutliple Tables of Employee Information with SQL 

Research and analyze employees of a corporation using data modeling with ERD tables, data engineering with SQL, data analytics and visualizations with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SQLAlchemy.

This is a solo project with the responsability of a data engineer at X company. The first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the the database of employees from that period are six CSV files that we will load into a SQL database and demonstrate different ways in which SQL can be used to query data. 

## Understanding Data Relationship or Data Modeling 
It is best to explore the data using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) model before diving into the SQL database. An ERD is a data modeling technique that graphically displays an information system's entities and the relationship between those entities. You can create entities (tables), add attributes(columns), and create relationships between those entities.
